# confluence-enhancer
Enhance Confluence pages by offering a "find and replace" service live in the DOM.

# How does it work?
Instructions in Confluence might have multiple instances of "copy and paste" commands to acheive things.
In some cases these require a small tweak every time they're run - for example to cope with a filename change.

The aim of this project is to live replace $$variable_name with a value, allowing easily adjustable live-documentation.

The author links to this Repo where anyone can install the plugin for Chromium Browsers.

The plugin can be toggled on or off by clicking on the plugin icon and toggling the switch

Values to replace can be found in the dropdown once the plugin is clicked on.
